The International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau contains various demographic
data from 1950 to the present (and projections until 2060) for over 200 countries
with a population of 5,000 or more. The underlying data are based on the respective
countries’ official demographic statistics—e.g. in form of censuses, surveys, administrative
records—or on estimates and projections by the U.S. Census Bureau itself.

The data set in the file census_2022_2002.csv contains a small extract from the IDB.
It includes life expectancy at birth and total fertility rates for 228 countries from 2002
and 2022. For the exact definitions of these variables see https://www.census.gov/
programs-surveys/international-programs/about/glossary.html. Life expectancy
is stratified by sex. The countries are divided geographically into 5 regions and 21 subregions.

This project is done using appropriate statistical measures and graphical methods for the
analysis.
